        <h1>Mapping Berlin's Squats</h1>
        <p><br></br>
            Mapping Berlin's famous occupied houses was an insightful and engaging project. I began by downloading
            essential vector layers from Open Street Maps, providing a detailed foundation for the map. To ensure
            comprehensive coverage, I also obtained data on Berlin's boroughs from Princeton University's mapping
            project. With these layers in hand, I set the project's spatial reference system to WGS 84 / UTM Zone 33,
            ensuring accuracy and consistency across all data points.

            Next, I focused on processing the vector data. I exported the relevant boroughs, Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg
            and Mitte, which are known for their historical squatting movements. These areas were clipped to create
            layers for waterways, water bodies, buildings, roads, railways, and land use, each specifically named to
            reflect their focus on these boroughs. This meticulous clipping ensured that the map would highlight the key
            geographical features of these iconic neighborhoods.

            A crucial part of the project was the creation of polygon vector layers for each squatting building. By
            selecting and exporting these features, I created individual layers for each squat, including those that had
            been evicted and those still standing. This differentiation provided a clear visual representation of the
            status of these squats. To enhance the map's detail, I also found the centroids for these layers, creating
            precise point layers for each squatting building, evicted and standing.

            One of the more challenging aspects was georeferencing the Berlin Wall. With no free data available for the
            wall's extent, I used a Google Maps screenshot and georeferenced it to overlay on the project map. By
            creating a LineString vector layer, I was able to represent the Berlin Wall accurately, adding an important
            historical context to the map.

            Styling the vector layers was another critical step. I adjusted labels, opacity, stroke styles, and widths
            to ensure that each layer was visually distinct and informative. The buildings and waterways were styled
            using a color palette inspired by Johannes Vermeer’s "Glass of Wine," a nod to Berlin’s rich artistic
            heritage. Adding labels to the water and styling the squats, both evicted and standing, with SVG icons,
            enhanced the map's readability.

            Finally, I arranged the layers for optimal visual presentation and created a new layout. This involved
            turning off certain layers for clarity, adding main and inset maps, and locking the layers and styles to
            maintain consistency. The finishing touches included adding a legend, north arrows, scale bars, and relevant
            pictures and credits. Through this project, I was able to create a detailed and visually appealing map that
            highlights the significant historical and cultural impact of Berlin's famous squats.
